Q1. Can you use Nmap to identify # of hosts on a network and what is the command?
ANS: Yes, Nmap can identify the number of hosts on a network. The command is ```nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24```

Q2. What does command “nmap -sT -p 80,443 192.168.1.0/24” do?
ANS: The command ```nmap -sT -p 80,443 192.168.1.0/24``` performs a TCP connect scan (-sT) on IP addresses within the range ```192.168.1.0/24```, specifically checking for open ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to check if they are accessible.
```~ nmap -sT -p 80,443 192.168.1.0/24 Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.orgLinks to an external site. ) at 2024-12-06 19:03 PST Stats: 0:00:21 elapsed; 0 hosts completed (0 up), 256 undergoing Ping Scan Ping Scan Timing: About 20.51% done; ETC: 19:04 (0:01:21 remaining) Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 104.23 seconds```

Q3. What is the 3 ways handshake?
ANS: The 3-way handshake is the process used to establish a TCP connection between a client and a server. The steps are:
SYN: The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to initiate the connection.
SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet to acknowledge the request and confirm the willingness to establish a connection.
ACK: The client then sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet, finalizing the establishment of the connection.

Q4. What does the Capital S option do in Nmap?
ANS: The -S option in Nmap is used to specify the source IP address for the scan. This allows you to change the IP address Nmap uses when sending packets. This is typically used in cases of IP spoofing or to make the scan appear to originate from a different address.

Q5. What does the RST Flag in a TCP conversation?
ANS: The RST (Reset) flag in a TCP conversation is used to abruptly terminate a connection. It is sent when one of the parties wants to refuse or reset an existing connection, indicating that it doesn't want to continue with the current session.

Q6. What does the -O Option do in Nmap?
ANS: The -O option in Nmap enables OS detection. It attempts to identify the operating system running on the target host by analyzing various characteristics of the TCP/IP stack, such as response patterns to different probes. ```nmap -O 192.168.1.1```

Q7. What is the purpose of the -D option in Nmap?
ANS: The -D option in Nmap is used for decoy scanning. It makes the scan appear as if it's originating from multiple IP addresses, making it harder to trace the source of the scan. This is useful for evading detection by security systems. ```nmap -D 192.168.1.2,192.168.1.3 192.168.1.0/24```

Q8. What does the command “nmap –script vuln 192.168.1.1” do?
ANS: The command nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.1 runs Nmap’s Scripting Engine (NSE) with the vuln script category. It scans the target (192.168.1.1) for known vulnerabilities and uses predefined scripts to identify any potential security issues or weaknesses on the host.
```➜ ~ nmap –script vuln 192.168.1.1 Unparseable option (dash, not '-') in argument 1 QUITTING! ➜ ~ nmap -script vuln 192.168.1.1 Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.orgLinks to an external site. ) at 2024-12-06 19:06 PST Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 13.37 seconds```

Q9. What is a “CVE”?
ANS: A CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a publicly disclosed cybersecurity vulnerability or exposure that is assigned a unique identifier. It provides information about the nature of the vulnerability, the software or hardware affected, and available mitigation strategies. CVEs are widely used in the security community to track vulnerabilities and exposures.

Q10 Explain NMAP scanning and enumeration
ANS: Nmap scanning is the process of discovering devices, open ports, services, and other network details through various types of scans like ping scan, port scan, and OS detection. Enumeration goes further, gathering detailed information about the services and systems identified, such as version information, usernames, or system configurations. Nmap offers different scan types such as:
Ping scans (-sn) to identify live hosts.
Port scans (-p) to find open ports.
Service and version detection (-sV) to determine service versions.
OS detection (-O) to identify the operating system.
Together, scanning and enumeration help in mapping the network and assessing its security posture.
